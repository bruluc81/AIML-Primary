## Objective:
The classification goal is to predict the likelihood of a liability customer buying personal loans.

## Steps and Tasks:
Read the column description and ensure you understand each attribute well
Study the data distribution in each attribute, share your findings
Get the target column distribution. Your comments
Split the data into training and test set in the ratio of 70:30 respectively
Use different classification models (Logistic, K-NN and Na√Øve Bayes) to predict the likelihood of a liability customer buying personal loans
Print the confusion matrix for all the above models
Give your reasoning on which is the best model in this case and why it performs better?

## Visual Analysis of the Data using MS Excel
Total 5000 rows and 14 columns

CCAvg is in decimal and all the others are integers.
Income / CCAvg / Mortgage - these values are noted in 000's
Education is depicted in numbers 1 for Under Grad, 2 for Grad, 3 for advanced/prof
Personal Loan / Securities Account / CD Account / Online / CreditCard are Yes / No types and are documented as 0 or 1. No other value is found in these columns
